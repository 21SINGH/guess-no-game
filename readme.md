# Guess the Number Game

This React Native app is a fun guessing game where the user picks a number, and the app attempts to guess it. The user provides hints (`higher` or `lower`) to help the app reach the correct number. The game ends by showing how many rounds it took and the number that was guessed.

## How to Play
